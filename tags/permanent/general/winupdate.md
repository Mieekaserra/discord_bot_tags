### Windows Version Update
If you are having issues logging into one or more of the websites needed to download mods through Wabbajack or Wabbajack is crashing on the spash screen

The most likely cause is that your OS is not up to date.

For windows 11 - This is the best checked by making sure you have the 23H2 OR 24H2 service pack installed & have no pending Updates . If you need to Update your windows 11 - you can do so by by going to this link <https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11>

For windows 10 - Home/Pro editions this is the best checked by making sure you have the 22H2 service pack installed, build 19045.5198 or newer. If you need to Update your windows 10 - you can do so by by going to this link <https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10>

For windows 10 LTSC, IoT Enterprise & custom ISO's (including the use of debloaters) - you are out of luck, as those releases do not support .net9 which wabbajack now needs to run. 

If you are not sure what version of windows you are running Press `Windows + R`, and type in Winver. Screenshot the window and post the screenshot in this channel. Staff will be able to tell you what you need to do.

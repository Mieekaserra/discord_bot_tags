## Can I install more than one Modlist?

Yes, each modlist installs its own portable instance of MO2. Modlists can share the same downloads folder but must have their own installation folder.

If one of your modlists does not use the Stock Game feature, you can use ENB and/or Reshade Managers to handle swapping between different ENB/ReShade profiles.

**Modlists CANNOT be merged together.**

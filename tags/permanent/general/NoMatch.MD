## No Match in Stack

This Message simply means that wabbajack cannot find a source for one or more of the files in your list.

Most often this is caused by a lack of harddrive space during compliation which prevents wabbajack from extracting everything to build its download cache. 

Other Common reasons to explain this.

1. For Skyrim_Misc.BSA You are trying to match 1.6.640 Stock Game files (or older) to 1.6.1170 Game files. The Misc.bsa file from 1.6.1170 should be used in your stock game folder as it removed some Unused references which are listed within the 1.6.640 BSA or Older.
2. You dont have a download or meta for one of the files included in your list - Please see the wiki article [here](https://wiki.wabbajack.org/modlist_author_documentation/Pre-Compilation.html?highlight=everything%20must%20have%20a%20source#everything-comes-from-somewhere) which explains this in detail.
3. Use have used the Nexus version of Mod organiser (or include files from it), not the Github portable version.
4. You have outputs from tools such as Dyndolod which do not have a download source (refer to the link in point 2)
5. Nexuscat - This file is generated by mod organiser when you install mods, you can either include or ignore it in your modlist compilation settings.
6. Your Wabbajack Cache is corrupt / missing files due to a previous failed compilation. (You should do a WJReset to fix this. Note: Backup author-api-key.txt if you have one first and reinstall it once you restarted wabbajack. You will need to log back in afterwards )

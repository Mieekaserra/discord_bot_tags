## AI Tools are WRONG!

AI chats are dumb predictive text generators and NOT artificial intelligence.
So they are the same as if you used your smartphone typed out your question and then hit whatever word your keyboard predicts you are typing.
That prediction is literally the same thing those so called "AI"s are doing.

We are not here to fix the garbage that those "AI"s recommended you should do or interpreting what gibberish it spits out.

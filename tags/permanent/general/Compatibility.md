## Game store Compatibility

Wabbajack works by replicating the modlist author's setup on your PC. This means that in order to install a list, the installed version of the game typically must come from the same store as the list Authors.

Wabbajack files cannot be ported to work on other game stores (E.G Epic games / Gamepass doesnt support script extenders so all skyrim/fallout lists cannot run on these platforms). GoG is compatible, but it requires the list author to make a specific GOG version of the list and most dont do that.

* If a list Author specifies you need Steam to install, you need steam to install. 
* If the list author specifies you need the GOTY version including all DLC's - they arent lying. you do need that.
* If the list author says PCR/German versions cannot be supported - they cannot. 

The readme will Always tell you what store's games are supported and which are not.

## Antivirus Interference

If you are experiencing problems running Wabbajack such as the exe being deleted or no progress during the installation phase, try adding your Wabbajack folder (where the executable is located) and your selected modlist installation location to exclusions in your antivirus of choice.

**Note**: If you're using a 3rd party antivirus (such as AVG, Avast, BitDefender, Webroot, Kaspersky, Norton, McAfee etc.) it is possible that adding the folders to exclusions will not be enough and you may need to disable or uninstall your 3rd party AV as they can incorrectly mark files like `usvfs proxy x86.exe` (required for MO2) as a virus.

If you still think a file is a virus, you can upload it to [virustotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) and have it checked.

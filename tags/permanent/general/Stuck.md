## You think your Wabbajack is stuck?

Firstly check in task manager, if you disk you are installing to is at 100% on the performance tab that could be causing a bottleneck as downloads won't continue if it cant write to disk. If other programs are using your disk, then wabbajack cannot and it will wait until the drive becomes available. You should leave wabbajack alone if this is the case and address the other programs which are using resources wabbajack needs.

If this isnt the case, and if Wabbajack itself not using *a lot* of CPU/Network/disk resources then its likely frozen.

You can safely restart wabbajack, select your modlist from the gallery and enter the same paths to resume the install.

Wabbajack will the Hash check your existing downloads and continue from the point it got stuck.

## How do I move nexus window because I cant see progress bars?

You will see progress bars once you have filled your download queue. 

The reason that is popping up in the first place is you have Wabbajack set by default to attempt multiple downloads at the same time (Located in Settings > performance > downloads) and it'll keep popping up nexus windows like that until all the queue spots are full.

If you dont wan't wabbajack to do multiple downloads, or you want to restrict it to 2-4 downloads at once you can change it in the settings.

You cannot move/minimise this window while its present as we have had issues in the past of users minimising or closing the download window and then complaining because their install has "frozen".

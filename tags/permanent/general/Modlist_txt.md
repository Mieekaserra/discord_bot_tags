# Crashing when Selecting Modlists.txt

If wabbajack crashes when you select your modlist.txt then this is because you have used Nexus to install mod organiser rather than using the "loose" files Github version.

Nexus version does not create a "true" Portable Mod Orgnaiser instance. To fix this you will need to convert your Mod organiser into a true portable instance. Instructions to do that are [here](https://wiki.wabbajack.org/modlist_author_documentation/Compilation%20Issues%20FAQ.html#portable-instances).

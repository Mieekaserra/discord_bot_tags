## Intel Powerdraw Bug

Intel 13th and 14th gen i7 and i9 CPUs are all susceptible to a power draw bug

Wabbajack is not at fault.

Your CPU has degraded to the point it is unable to run at high load without undervolting or reducing core ratio. Wabbajack is a system intensive application, but anything else that pushes any real stress on it will similarly cause crashing if your clock multiplier is too high. 

The issue will get worse until you warranty or replace the CPU.

Temporary work around: under-volt the CPU

See the following article for details and under-volt/core ratio instructions <https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/intels-raptor-lake-desktop-cpu-bug-what-to-know-what-to-do-now>

# Congratulations on getting featured!

First up we'll get the repo stuff sorted so your modlist appears as a featured list on the UI & the website. 

1. Edit your modlist.json to have "official": true, and also add the "Official" tag. 
2. Submit a pull request to add your repository json to the featured list json. If your modlist is featured in an [existing repository](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/mod-lists/blob/master/featured_lists.json), please structure it as so: repository/machineURL  

3. If you havent already, make a pull request for this document that we use to suggest modlists to include your list to [modlist-descriptions](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/mod-lists/blob/master/modlist-descriptions.md)

You also now have access to our internal installation metrics. These **ARE NOT** publicly sharable and we reserve the right to revoke access if they are shared, please keep this in mind: https://build.wabbajack.org/metrics.html

Be sure to check out the pins for some useful information on Wabbabot release messages, the CDN and general other stuff.

# Adding your list to the Wabbakinator

The Wabbakinator is a tool for users to find a list they want to play and it covers all of the supported Wabbajack games.

If you want to add your list or make any changes in the future, it is up to you to provide the information to differentiate your list from others. Please ping [J.T.K](@257108926741348353), [Crit](@243442155698388993), and [ZÃ©lie](@476532467428229146) in <#1272286658922020924> with what you want to change it to.

We'll obviously help if we can but the onus is on you to provide the information to help direct users to your list. This also goes onto the "To-do" list for things if you create and gain featured on another list.

Please copy and paste the following template into a new message and fill it in, or link the github issue that contains this info:

```
List name:
Author(s):
**Banner image/video (if video first frame is the thumbnail):
(Optional) Up to 5 accompanying 16:9 showcase images:
Does the game require anything more than the base game? If yes, what does it require (any specific DLCs that are not included in the base game or the Anniversary Edition DLC count):
Up to 6 tags to define your modlist:
A description up to 270 characters long (might need to be shorter based on modlist name and if requiring any DLCs, due to space constraints, will discuss on a modlist to modlist basis):
Find out more link (readme/wiki/etc):
Community link (Discord, Guilded, etc):
Where in the quiz do you think your list would fit:```

A massive thank you to the contributions of Chanka, Zelie and the others who helped make this possible.

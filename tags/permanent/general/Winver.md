## Wabbajack Crashing

Wabbajack is running .net version 9 and requires that your OS be up to date. 

For windows 11 - This is the best checked by making sure you have the 24H2 service pack installed & have no pendind Updates.
For windows 10 - Home/Pro editions this is the best checked by making sure you have the 22H2 service pack installed.

For windows 10 LTSC, IoT Enterprise & custom ISO's (including the use of debloaters) - you are out of luck, as those releases do not support .net9.

If you are not sure what version of windows you are running Press `Windows + R`, to run Winver. screenshot the window and post here. Staff will be able to tell you what you need to do.

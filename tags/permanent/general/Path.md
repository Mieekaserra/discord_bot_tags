## Could not find part of the path "TEMP_BSA_FILES"

This is typically caused by a problem extracting zip files. 

The quickest resolution is as follows
1. Close wabbajack
2. Go to your install folder and locate the `TEMP_BSA_FILES` folder if it exists.
3. Empty that folder if it exists
4. Restart wabbajack
5. Restart Modlist installation.

Note: Using the retry button will not work as wabbajack does not understand that there was a issue with extraction and will not retry extraction steps.

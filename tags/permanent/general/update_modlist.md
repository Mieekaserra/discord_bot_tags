## Updating a Wabbajack Modlist

To update a Modlist, simply run Wabbajack again and get the newest list file from the Gallery. Select the same Download and Install folders you chose previously.

Backup any changes you have made to the modlist since your original install as these will be lost.

If you want to keep any mods you've added to your personal install, rename those mods to start with `[NoDelete]` to force Wabbajack to skip those files.  
Note that support still won't be officially provided; use this feature at your own discretion.

## Hanging/Stalled Downloads. 

If you suspect that your downloads have stalled and have not made any progress for a long time, you can check task manager to confirm. 

Download speeds shown on the UI are for guidance only and showing no download does not mean wabbajack has stalled.

Wabbajack should be using large amounts of CPU and/or network and/or Disk while it is downloading. 

If task manager shows negligible amounts of usage, the it can be safely restarted. 

You can then resume your list install by browsing to the list in the gallery, making sure your install paths and download paths are the same as the first time you ran.

Wabbajack will then Hash check your downloads and resume from the point it got stuck.

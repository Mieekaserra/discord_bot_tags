## Modlist Readme's

Modlist readme's contain all the information you need on how to install, configure and play the modlist. 

These will automatically open in your wabbajack when you open a modlist to start an installation. Make sure you complete all the Pre-installation steps before starting your install.

If you are being given this bot message, then the question you have asked or the issue you have have is covered by the readme. 

Should you have failing downloads - such as those from loverslab - these are typically found on the readme itself, or from the dedicated support channels for the list linked from the readme. Wabbajack staff cannot assist you with mirrors for failing files.

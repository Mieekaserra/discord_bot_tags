## Modlist Readme's

Modlist readme's contain all the information you need on how to install, configure and play the modlist. 

These will automatically open in your wabbajack when you open a modlist to start an installation. Make sure you complete all the Pre-installation steps before starting your install.

Should you have failing downloads - these are typically found either on the readme itself, or from the dedicated support channels linked from the readme.

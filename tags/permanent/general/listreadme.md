## Modlist Readme's

Modlist readme's contain all the information you need on how to install, configure and play the modlist. 

These will automatically open in your browser when you start, and complete a installation.

Should you have failing downloads - these are typically found either on the readme itself, or from the dedicated support channels linked from the readme.

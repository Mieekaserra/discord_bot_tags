## Nexus API Limits
Wabbajack uses the Nexus Mods API in order to automatically download files (only available with a Nexus Mods Premium account). The API has a limit to restrict the number of automated interactions a user account can have with the site in a given time frame in order to help mitigate the site being impacted by massive volumes of requests.

**If you run out of API calls you will have to wait until they reset or manually download missing mods and put them in your downloads folder.**

**API allocations reset daily at <t:1731024000:t> (Midnight UTC).**

*This is a limitation imposed by Nexus Mods and cannot be circumvented or changed by Wabbajack.*

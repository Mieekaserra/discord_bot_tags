## Hash Fails 

Hashes for BSA or TEMP_BSA_FILES failures  is generally hardware related, and staff cannot unfortunatly wave a magic wand and resolve it for you.

The most common cause for this issue is usually caused by running out of drive space (especially if your primary system drive or install drive is fairly low on free space) while it's unzipping and/or patching. You should generally make sure you have **30GB** more than the list requires free on both drives.

Some users also report that the issue is a result of overclocking your CPU. (Specifically amd overclocking on auto, but Intel cpu's may also have the same issue)

Most users can generally brute force it through by running the install over and over until it succeeds, especially if it's failing on different files every time. But you can also try removing any overclocking you have enabled and see if that resolves the fails.

Finally As a last resort (note this will not work if the list requires downloads from MEGA) you can try a older version of wabbajack. You should ONLY do this if you are getting **consistent failures on the same files**, the hash fail mentions a **"SHA1"** fail, or you have retried 20+ times and have checked overclocking is off and you have sufficiant free space on your drives.

 **Downgrade Wabbajack to [3.6.1.1](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases/download/3.6.1.1/3.6.1.1.zip)**  
   Get that zip file, unzip it somewhere (**a folder called 3.6.1.1 inside the directory where you're currently running Wabbajack from is a good idea**).  
   Run Wabbajack from inside that folder and choose the same folders as you currently do.  

### UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU DELETE ANY PART OF THE MODLIST

### Can I use Wabbajack with Gamepass?
**Short answer - NO.**

Long answer - Script extenders (such as SKSE for Skyrim or F4SE for Fallout 4) are currently not compatible with Gamepass versions of Bethesda games. Without these, it is not possible to run complex mods commonly found in Wabbajack modlists.

```"SKSE will support the latest version of Skyrim available on Steam, and only this version /.../. It is extremely unlikely that any future non-SE Skyrim updates will be released.

SKSE cannot support any potential Windows Store release of Skyrim. Windows Store applications are locked down similarly to consoles and do not allow the APIs necessary for script extenders to work."```

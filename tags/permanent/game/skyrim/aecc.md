## Anniversary DLC/Creation Club Content

### Your chosen modlist requires the purchasable Anniversary Edition DLC.

Please make sure you've bought it for the same storefront version as your Skyrim Special Edition.
[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1746860/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Anniversary_Upgrade/) or [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_anniversary_upgrade). If using steam the account currently logged in MUST own it themselves, it will not work with family sharing as the content is downloaded from bethesda's server's not steam's and the AE Upgrade is only linked to the steam account which purchased it.

If you have already bought AE and your log says you are missing creation club content (*Data_ccvsvsse003-necroarts.esl, Data_ccbgssse069-contest.esl, etc...*) then you need to download the content from within the game.

* Launch Skyrim from Steam
* Select Creations from the main menu
* Select Options at the bottom
* Select Download all owned Creation Club Creations
* Exit the game
* Re-run Wabbajack

**DO NOT Alt+Tab; you must leave the game window active or the download will stop.**

### If Wabbajack still reports missing AE files

If "download all" doesn't work and some files are still missing, check your Wabbajack log for the missing DLC files, match them with the relevant Creation Club mod [from this list](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Creation_Club_Content_by_Filename) and download each one manually from the in-game Creation Club menu.

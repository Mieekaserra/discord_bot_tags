## Unable to download 'Curios' files

If your log shows references to 'Curios' files failing to download,
i.e. `Unable to download Data_ccbgssse037-curios`

Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your Steam's Skyrim Special Editon's Data folder.
2. Within the data folder, delete the 2 curios files `ccbgssse037-curios.bsa` and `ccbgssse037-curios.esl`.
3. Launch Skyrim Special Edition from Steam.
4. Select Creations from the main menu.
5. Select Options at the bottom.
6. Select Download all owned Creation Club Creations.
7. Exit the game.
8. Rerun the Wabbajack installer.

### DO NOT Alt+Tab; you must leave the game window active or the download will stop.

If Wabbajack still reports missing Curios
Check your `Skyrim Special Edition\Data` folder to see if they exist, if they don't - download 'Rare curios' manually from the in-game Creation Club menu.

# SE Creation kit

Install the latest version of the [Skyrim Special Edition: Creation Kit](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946180/Skyrim_Special_Edition_Creation_Kit/). Double check it's on the same steam library as skyrim itself.

If that still doesn't work you can try to Verify integrity of game files for the Creation Kit.

Please note: You need the special edition version of Creation kit, not the Oldrim version.

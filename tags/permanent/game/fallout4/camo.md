## Unable to download 'Camo' files

If your manual helper file or log file shows references to 'Camo1' files failing to download,
i.e. `Unable to download Data_ccBGSFO4003-PipBoy(Camo01)`

Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your Steam's Fallout 4's Data folder.
2. Within the data folder, locate the 2 "Camo" files, `ccbgsfo4003-pipboy(camo01) - main.ba2` and `ccbgsfo4003-pipboy(camo01) - textures.ba2`.
3. Make note of whether the word `camo` starts with a lower case `c` or upper case `C`.
4. Delete the two files.

If the files started with a lower case `c`,
1. Open Steam.
2. Right click on Fallout 4. Select Properties.  Select Installed Files.  Click on the `Verify integrity` button.
3. Once the files have been verified, go back to your Fallout4\data folder and confirm that you now have two new files that start with an upper case C.
4. Rerun the Wabbajack installation.

If the files started with an upper case `C`,
1. Launch Fallout 4 from Steam.
2. Select Creation Club from the main menu.
3. Click `Download all` or press SpaceBar to download all owned Creations.
5. Wait until all Creations have been downloaded.   
   **DO NOT Alt+Tab; you must leave the game window active or the download will stop.**
6. Exit the game.  DO NOT perform a verify in Steam.
7. Go back to your Fallout4\data folder and verify that you now have two new files that start with a lower case c.
8. Rerun the Wabbajack installation.

## Missing game file InstallScript.vdf

If your manual helper file or log file shows references to 'InstallScript' file failed to download,
i.e. `Missing game file InstallScript.vdf`

Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your **Steam**'s **Fallout New Vegas** folder.
2. Within the installation folder, look for `InstallScript.vdf` and open it with Notepad.
3. Search for a line that says "run process" or "Run Process" (line 13).

* If the line is written as "run process", rewrite it to "Run Process" (capitalized).

* If the line is written as "Run Process", rewrite it to "run process" (lowercase).

Close Wabbajack, if you haven't already, and try installing the modlist again.
